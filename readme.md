# Hi there, I'm Divyanshu! 👋

I'm a **DevOps Engineer** who gets an absolute **kick** out of solving the most challenging problems and building products that scale to millions. There's nothing quite like the rush of architecting systems that handle massive traffic and seeing them perform flawlessly under pressure.

## ✨ About Me

- **DevOps & Infrastructure Architect** obsessed with turning impossible challenges into elegant, scalable solutions.
- I **live for the thrill** of building rock-solid systems that millions depend on daily.
- Successfully architected and scaled production infrastructures for **high-stakes industries like banking** – where failure isn't an option.

## 🚀 Technical Skills

### Programming 💻

- **Golang, TypeScript, Rust, Python, Ruby** – building scalable microservices and business-critical apps like credit card management and transaction systems.

### Cloud and DevOps ☁️

- **AWS wizard** crafting infrastructure magic with Terraform and AWS CDK.
- Battle-tested across **GCP** and **Azure** – because real DevOps engineers master multi-cloud chaos.
- Architected **mission-critical systems** with bulletproof networking that never goes down.

### Kubernetes & Infrastructure 🛠️

- **Orchestrated 30+ EKS clusters** powering 250+ engineers – because scaling teams is just as important as scaling systems.
- Built **automated CI/CD pipelines** with bulletproof RBAC, network policies, and multi-tenant architectures that just work.
- **Helm, Kustomize, and Istio** are my tools of choice for taming container chaos.
- Designed **multi-region disaster recovery** strategies and comprehensive observability with ELK Stack and Victoria Metrics – because downtime is not an option.

### Security & Compliance 🔒

- Aligned architectures with **PCI DSS**, **ISO 27001**, **SOC 2 Type 2**, and **RBI PPI/DLG** standards.
- Successfully verified by **RBI** in CSITE and other regulatory audits.

## 🛠️ What Gets Me Fired Up

- ⚙️ **Infrastructure as Code** – because manual deployments are for amateurs
- 🕸️ **Service Mesh** – connecting the dots in complex distributed systems
- 🛡️ **Secure Systems Design** – building fortresses that hackers can't breach
- 📈 **Observability and Reliability** – making systems that self-heal and scale infinitely

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

**Are you someone who thrives on:**
- 🔥 Solving **impossible technical challenges** that others run from?
- 🚀 Building products that **scale to millions** and handle massive traffic?
- 💪 The adrenaline rush of **high-stakes DevOps** work?

**If you're passionate about crafting systems that can handle anything the world throws at them, let's connect! I'm always looking for fellow problem-solvers who share this obsession.**
