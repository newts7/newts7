# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new, minimal repository with only an empty readme.md file. The project appears to be in its initial state with no established codebase, dependencies, or development tooling yet.

## Development Environment

- Git repository is initialized
- No package.json, build tools, or dependencies are currently configured
- No existing source code files

## Architecture

The project structure is minimal and has not yet been established. Future development will need to define:
- Project type and technology stack
- Build and development tooling
- Source code organization
- Testing framework

## Common Commands

No build, test, or lint commands are currently available as the project lacks configuration files and dependencies.

## Getting Started

This repository is in its initial state. To begin development, you'll need to:
1. Define the project type and technology stack
2. Initialize appropriate package management (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Set up build tooling and development dependencies
4. Create initial source code structure
